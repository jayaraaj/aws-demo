# AWS Modernization Workshop 
Topic: Test Automation in DevOps
Created by Cognizant (https://www.cognizant.com/)

Abstract for Workshop:
Digital transformation requires speed and efficiency across the DevOps lifecycle. At the same time, this enhanced speed and efficiency should not come at the cost of quality and overall customer experience. Based on our experience, we believe that the best way to achieve these goals is through the introduction of continuous testing in DevOps.

Join to learn: To introduce you to the world of testing in DevOps, we have planned hands-on exercises and induced real time problems that we will de-bug and fix together in this workshop.

- Why QA is integral to a successful DevOps implementation
- How testing in DevOps is different than traditional testing
- What types and stages of testing are essential for end-to-end quality assurance
- How to build and execute the continuous testing pipeline
- What are the various tooling alternatives, enablers and best practices in testing for DevOps
- How to integrate open source tool-based automation suites in the pipeline
