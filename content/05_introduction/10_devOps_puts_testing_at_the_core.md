A prevailing myth around DevOps is that it builds high-quality applications by simply fostering coordination between developers and operation teams; thereby eliminating the need for testing. 

On the contrary, DevOps transforms the role of testing from that of a gatekeeper to a guardian of quality. It dismantles testing from its traditionally siloed position toward the end gates, and embeds it at each stage - thus orchestrating testing across the lifecycle to deliver quality at speed.

DevOps-aligned testing shifts left and helps developers run quality checks, even before they start coding. It also plays a crucial role in production where it monitors incidents and rectifies defects before they affect customer experience, all the while rendering a faster feedback loop for proactive defect detection.
