Previously, there was a popular misconception about DevOps, that bringing development and operations teams together would result in greater efficiency, eliminating the very need for testing. However, it was quickly realized that this was not the case. On the contrary, DevOps transformed the role of testing from that of a gatekeeper to a guardian of quality across the lifecycle. This transition eliminates testing silos and instead embeds it in each stage of the DevOps process to deliver much needed quality at speed.

Testing in DevOps, shifts left towards Development, by helping the Dev team embrace testing to run quality checks during the development process itself, often before they start coding. At the same time, Testing in DevOps also shifts right towards Operations, allowing for incidents in production to be detected faster and before they adversely affect the end-user experience.
