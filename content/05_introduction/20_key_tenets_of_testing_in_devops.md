Testing in DevOps is characteristically different from traditional testing. For a successful DevOps program, testing needs to be:


- **Collaborative:** As developers, testers and operations teams work together to ensure a robust application, testing becomes a collaborative endeavor that is democratized at every stage to get quality right, the first time.  
- **Continuous:** With democratization, testing becomes a shared responsibility and is executed continuously across the lifecycle. In a typical DevOps pipeline, automated test scripts are integrated at every stage to engineer quality into the code as it progresses through the lifecycle.
- **Cognitive:** By leveraging artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms, testing can predict defects before they occur, thereby keeping DevOps pipelines on full throttle.
- **Cloud-Ready:**

As you start your DevOps journey, Cognizant can help you embrace an automation-first approach to testing and orchestrate quality through the pipeline. 

We are recognized leaders on Gartnerâ€™s Magic Quadrants for Testing Services and Cloud Enablement. As the trusted QA partner for over 800 global organizations, we enable our clients accelerate innovation by fostering collaboration between partners and communities. 

At Cognizant, we believe software quality is assured when it is engineered into the application, rather than tested in. Going forward, we will be using Quality Assurance (QA) to denote testing.
