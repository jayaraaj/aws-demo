#### Static Testing

Static testing validates the code and its associated documentation without executing the program. It may be conducted manually or automated via various tools. Specific types of static testing include code analysis, inspection, code reviews and walkthroughs.

#### Unit Testing

Unit testing scrutinizes the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, individually and independently. Plugged in during the development process by the software developers, unit testing helps isolate written code to test and determines if it works as intended.

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage is one of the many metrics that determine the exhaustiveness, and hence effectiveness, of a test strategy. It analyzes the number of lines of code successfully validated and helps teams gauge how comprehensively an application was tested before go-live. 


#### Regression Testing

Regression testing assesses if changes to an application, or its components, introduce defects. A QA engineer performs these exercises to see if code modifications break or hinder the way in which the application works or how it consumes resources.
