#### Static Testing

Static testing is a software testing method that involves examination of the program's code and its associated documentation but does not require the program be executed. Dynamic testing, the other main category of software testing methods, involves interaction with the program while it runs. The two methods are frequently used together to try to ensure the functionality of a program.

Static testing may be conducted manually or through the use of various software testing tools. Specific types of static software testing include code analysis, inspection, code reviews and walkthroughs.

#### Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.  The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage is a software testing metric that determines the number of lines of code that is successfully validated under a test procedure, which in turn, helps in analyzing how comprehensively a software is verified.

Developing enterprise-grade software products is the ultimate goal of any software company. However, to accomplish this goal, companies have to ensure that the software they develop meets all the essential quality characteristics -- correctness, reliability, effectiveness, security, and maintainability. This can only be possible by thoroughly reviewing the software product.
Along with handing off the software to the QA engineers for bug tracking, it is imperative to analyze, monitor, measure test activities. This means, software testing metrics to evaluate the test suiteâ€™s effectiveness and completeness should be considered.
Code coverage is one such software testing metric that can help in assessing the test performance and quality aspects of any software.


#### Regression Testing

Regression testing is a type of software test that assesses if changes to an application, or other related software components, introduce defects. A quality assurance (QA) engineer performs these exercises to see if modifications to code break or hinder the way in which the application works or how it consumes resources.
