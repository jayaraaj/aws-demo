**Mythical Mysfits (MM)** is an e-commerce giant offering online shopping across a wide array of products. It services global customers via an omni-channel portal.

**Problem Statement** - MM intends to speed up their time to market with frequent releases to production.They have implemented a development pipeline, however their testing still follows a traditional waterfall approach, leading to issues such as:

- Increasing efforts spent on testing and re-testing the code changes
- Defects detected late in testing, costing significant effort, time and resources
- Siloed automation due to a hybrid tooling landscape
- Prolonged testing cycles impacting the overall speed of delivery to production 
- Too many production incidents
- Poor user feedbacks



**The Assignment** - MM has commissioned Cognizant Consultants to help them modernize their testing practices. Cognizant will enable earlier defect detection and higher-quality deployments by embedding continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines. MM has individual automation suites that Cognizant will orchestrate in the continuous testing pipeline to demonstrate how to deliver Quality at Speed.
