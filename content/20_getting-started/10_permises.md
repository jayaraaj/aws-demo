### Problem Statement 

Mythical Mysfits (MM) is following a DevOps based pipeline for committing Code to the Repository and for all Test activities, it follows a more traditional waterfall based approach. With 2 disparate approaches, MM is noticing following issues:

1.	Frequent changes in newly deployed products that are not adequately tested and hence result in poor customer confidence
2.	Increased Costs due to delayed identification of bugs in Live environment
3.	Automation in pockets with diverse tools and an immediate need for tool integration / open source leverage

### Key focus areas for Testing in DevOps 
Mythical Mysfits (MM) has invited Cognizant Consultants to help them modernize their Quality Assurance & Automation testing practices. Cognizant is helping MM extend their CI/CD pipelines with continuous testing. MM already has multiple automation assets and Cognizant is going to enable them orchestrate it in pipeline leveraging AWS services. 

As part of this workshop, MM envisages Assurance to focus on the following objectives -

**1.	Fail early and fail fast with**
   -	Adopt DevOps to enable shifting Quality left and ensure higher collaboration between developers, testers and deployment teams 
   -	Increase Automation and continuous testing of the integrated DevOps pipeline to bolster speed and agility in product based releases
   -	Complement Testing by leveraging AI & ML technology to build cognitive approach to auto-remediate Automation scripts, proactively garner insights on defects and resolve requirement gaps / ambiguity.

**2.	Enable End-to-End Testing in CI/CD**
   -	Pre-build Assurance focusing on static code analysis, code coverage and Unit level Tests 
   -	Build & Deployment Assurance to cover Config.- based Tests, Smoke validation of deployed code and provision Test Data for forthcoming test cycles with structured Quality Gates
   -	Functional Assurance to validate the behaviors across UI, API and mobile along with detailed regression analysis on application
   -	Experience  Assurance to assess non-functional behavior of the application’s Performance, Accessibility and Security
   -	End-to-end Assurance of the complete Execution Pipeline with Dashboard based Test reporting and analysis

**3.	Leverage industry leading solutions and open sources alternatives**
   -	Identify key tools for each test component in scope 
   -	Recommend alternative Tools / Framework / Services that can additionally be plugged into the Test Lifecycle
