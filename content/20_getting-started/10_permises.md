**Mythical Mysfits (MM)** is an e-commerce giant offering online shopping across a wide array of products. It services global customers via an omni-channel website compatible with mobile and desktop.   

**Problem Statement** MM follows a DevOps-based pipeline for committing code to repository. However, its test activities still follow the waterfall approach, leading to issues such as:
- Defects in production.
- Costly bug fixes.
- Siloed automation due to a disjointed tool landscape.
- Poor customer confidence.


### Key focus areas for Testing in DevOps 
MM commissioned Cognizant Consultants to help it modernize its quality assurance & automation testing practices. Cognizant will enable earlier defect detection and higher-quality deployments by embedding continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines. MM already has multiple automation assets and Cognizant will orchestrate these in the pipeline leveraging AWS services. 

As part of this workshop, MM wants to focus on the following objectives -

**1.	1.	Fail early and fail fast by**
   - Shifting quality left through higher collaboration between developers, testers and deployment teams. 
   - Streamlining automation and integrating continuous testing in the DevOps pipeline.
   - Leveraging AI/ML to build cognitive QA approach to auto-remediate scripts 


**2.	Embed QA across CI/CD**
   - Pre-build assurance with static code analysis, code coverage and unit tests. 
   - Build & deployment assurance with configuration tests, smoke validation and data provisioning for forthcoming test cycles.
   - Functional assurance to validate the behaviors across UI, API and mobile.
   - Experience assurance to assess non-functional behavior vis-a-vis performance, accessibility and security.
   - End-to-end Assurance of the execution pipeline with dashboard-based reporting.



**3.	Leverage industry-leading solutions and open-source alternatives**
   - Identify key tools for each test component in scope.
   - Recommend alternative tools/ framework/ services for the test lifecycle.
