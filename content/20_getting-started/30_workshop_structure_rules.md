- **Scope**: For this workshop, we will focus on the execution stage of the testing pipeline and not the complete testing life cycle.
- **Modular Structure**: This workshop constitutes of five modules that explain a continuous testing pipeline in a chronological sequence. Each module provides an overview, relevant concepts and practices, before getting into the pipeline execution.

- **Solve and Learn**: We have induced few defects in the application code and test assets, so that you can debug and fix them to gain a more practical insight into this workshop.

- **Possibilities Infinitum**: There is no one right way to test an application. For this workshop, we have made a few broad assumptions for our testing approach, pipeline orchestration, tools and frameworks.

- **Meet Tikk!**: The over-enthusiastic, effervescent and self-confessed testing geek. Tikk is your assistant for this workshop. In the section - ‘Tikk Talk’, Tikk shares interesting info like - alternative approaches, practitioner tips, best practices, industry trends and trivia.
