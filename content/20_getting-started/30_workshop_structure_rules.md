#### Module Structure

1.	The workshop design covers five continuous but independent modules catering to specific areas in the testing lifecycle. Each module is created as a unit comprising of associated test activities and leading to a partially tested product. 
2.	Practitioners can review the module-based introductions for an overview of its scope.
3.	In the live Workshop, Cognizant consultants will pick specific modules for a deep dive and support hands-on testing of the sample application. 
4.	Workshop also gives the practitioner scope to introduce defects / issues and follow module-based steps to fix defects for a deeper understanding on the module.

1.	Requirement Analysis

#### Alternative Approaches available 

There are many ways of testing the same thing. Hence as part of this workshop, practitioners will be oriented with alternative approaches / reusable assets that can be applied to the standard method of building a continuous testing pipeline. Workshop lists out some of these alternative tools, services and frameworks for each type of Testing in scope.
