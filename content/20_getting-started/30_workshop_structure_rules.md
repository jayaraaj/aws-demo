#### Module based Structure 

1.	The workshop design coverâ€™s five continuous but independent modules catering to specific areas in the Testing Lifecycle. Each module is created as a unit comprising of associated Test activities and leading to a partially tested product. 
2.	Practitioners can review the Module-based introductions to get an understanding on the scope of testing types covered in a DevOps based pipeline.
3.	In the live Workshop, Cognizant consultants will pick specific modules for a deep dive and support the hands-on testing of the sample application in scope. 
4.	Workshop also gives scope the practitioner to introduce defects / issues in the pipeline and follow the module-based steps to fix the defect as a means of building a deeper understanding on the module. 

#### Test Activities not in scope 

Following activities are considered not in scope of this workshop: 

1.	Requirement Analysis 
2.	Test Design 
3.	Configuration Testing
4.	Test Data provisioning and 
5.	In-sprint Testing
6.	AI BoTs


#### Alternative Approaches available 

There are many ways of testing the same thing. Hence as part of this workshop, Practitioners will be oriented with alternative approaches / reusable assets that can be applied to the standard method of building a continuous testing pipeline. Workshop lists out some of these alternative tools, services and frameworks that can be applied to each type of Testing in scope like Functional Testing, Mobile, API based services, Performance etc.
