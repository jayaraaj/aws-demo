The cost of fixing an error grows exponentially as it proceeds undetected through the SDLC. Pre-build QA helps in detecting issues early on and preventing the costs of software errors. Especially from a DevOps perspective, it paves way for early testing, bringing in the required agility in the QA cycles and speeding up the time to market.

Well done! You have successfully fixed the error and executed Pre-Build Quality Assurance Pipeline.
