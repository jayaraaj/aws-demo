#### Objective: Testing Before Code Commit?

In software development, build refers to the process of converting files and other assets under developers’ responsibility into a software product in its final (or) consumable form. These activities cover:
Compile source files Package compiled files into compressed formats (like jar, zip)  Produce installers  Create (or) update Database schema (or) data


In DevOps, automated tests are plugged in even before the code is written. To deliver quality at speed, developers execute a series of automated test scripts prior to committing the code to a repository. This helps developers to assess the code and address any issues or bugs much earlier in the lifecycle, thereby engineering quality into the code as it progresses.
