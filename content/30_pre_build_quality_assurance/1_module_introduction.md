#### **Objective:** Testing Before Code Commit?

In DevOps, automated tests are plugged in even before the code is written until it is deployed into production. To deliver quality at speed, developers execute a series of automated test scripts prior to committing the code to a repository. This helps developers to assess the code and address any issues or bugs much earlier in the lifecycle, thereby engineering quality as the code progresses. 

#### **Testing scope:** What is covered?
- **Static Code Analysis** - Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. It is performed by developers by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules to addresses weaknesses in source code leading to vulnerabilities like code redundancy, reusable code, gaps in code etc.
- **Unit Testing + Mock Services / Virtualization** - A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. In unit testing, Developers focus on testing individual units / components of a software, with the purpose to validate each unit of the software performs as designed and in line with the requirements with basic functionality, fields and images being available. To unit test a component, Developers mock services accessed by the component to make them available while testing. 
- **Code Coverage** â€“ Developer need to measure the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. Organization prescribe thresholds / minimum amount for code coverage needed to be met before a software is pushed to the production thereby verifying code implementation so that almost all statements of code are executed. Higher percentage of code coverage ensures lower chances of having undetected bugs.  

#### Outcome delivered Benefits

- Shippable code quality with reduced maintenance effort
- Reduced cost of fixing defects due to early detection
- Remove duplicate / redundant code
