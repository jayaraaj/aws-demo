Let’s understand the nature of the failure.

**What is the failure?**

One of the unit tests named **‘Register - Last name should be present’** has failed because the ID of the UI object is incorrect while the unit test was written.


Instead of **‘lastname’**, the developer has updated it to **lastname1**.

**How to fix it?**

Go to “[AWS CodeCommit](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home)’ and navigate to below path:

**awswrkshp-aut-frontend -> test -> applicationcomponents -> testscripts -> unit_tests -> containers** and look for the file Register.test.js. 

**awswrkshp-aut-frontend -> test -> applicationcomponents -> testscripts -> unit_tests -> containers** and look for the file Register.test.js. This file has unit tests related to ‘registration’.

To fix this issue, go to line number `55` and change ‘**lastname1**’ to ‘**lastname**’. Refer screenshot as shown below:

The Commit Change to the **Register.test.js** file will trigger the pipeline automatically and this time, it will execute without errors. Refer screenshot as shown below for ‘succeeded’ status updated against each stage.

With the successful execution of the pipeline, you should have a working instance of your application under test, deployed in ECS. 

To access the application, replace the value of key ‘**ApplicationFrontEndURL_DevEnv**‘, which you have noted from the secrets (Secrets Manager) section, of the Getting Started section in below URL:
- Application Under Test URL is - `http://< ApplicationFrontEndURL_DevEnv>:3000`
