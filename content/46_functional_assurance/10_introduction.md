#### Objective: To validate the functional behaviours and regression impact 

Functions are “what” the system should do. Functional testing evaluates if functions perform as expected. Functional requirements may be described and documented in business requirements specifications, epics, user stories, use cases, (or) functional specifications, or they may be undocumented. These tests should be performed at all test levels, though the focus is different at each level.

- UI focuses on navigation, screen-based images etc.
- API focuses on backend services leveraged by frontend elements and objects.
- Mobile caters to a mobile-based interface/application functionality.
