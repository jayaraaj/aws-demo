#### Objective:

To ensure the application’s non-functional aspects, such as performance, accessibility & security, meet expectable/ pre-defined benchmarks.

It’s not always about if application works, but more importantly, how it works. An application should please the user in terms its performance, security and accessibility, commonly known as non-functional aspects. In a DevOps context, this becomes even more important since a code change could trigger new performance (or) security bugs.
