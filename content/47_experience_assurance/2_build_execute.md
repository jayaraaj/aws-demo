#### PIPELINE CREATION AND EXECUTION

{{% notice note %}}
Please complete the Module 2: Post-Build QA before commencing with this module. This will ensure you have deployed the build on the server successfully before executing the Experience test suits during this module.

Execute the cloud formation template from Cloud9 to automatically create the Experience Assurance pipeline.

```bash text
aws cloudformation  create-stack --stack-name ExperienceAssurance --template-url https://aws-wrkshp-artifacts.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/awsworkshop_infrastructure_artefacts/awsworkshop_experience_assurance.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

Go to the [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) console and check the status of your pipeline stack creation named ‘ExperienceAssurance’. It should state - {{% color info %}}“CREATE_IN_PROGRESS”{{% /color %}}.


**INFO**: This step takes approximately 1 minute and if successful, you can see the status of STACK - ‘ExperienceAssurance’ as {{% color success %}}“CREATE_COMPLETE”{{% /color %}}, as shown in the screenshot below

Go to the CloudFormation console and check the status of your pipeline stack creation named ‘ExperienceAssurance’. It should state - {{% color info %}}“CREATE_IN_PROGRESS”{{% /color %}}.


**Note**: On successful creation of the pipeline, the CFN will also auto trigger the execution. You can now view the execution progress by navigating to [CodePipeline](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home) and selecting **codepipeline_experience_assurance**

You will notice the pipeline fails at security testing and thus the subsequent step for accessibility test is not executed.

Let us fix this issue to re-execute the pipeline and check the overall non-functional impact of the code change committed.
