In DevOps, it is crucial to shift non-functional testing to left to provide faster feedbacks on potential performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities and accessibility issues. The pipeline moves through different stages of testing and generates reports on non-functional defects, addresses test incidents and confirms the overall state of experience delivered by the application.

For this workshop, we have only considered selective non-functional checks. However, in practice, assuring experience consists of a large gamut of non-functional tests and practices. 

Refer diagram below for the types of tests for Experience Assurance:
