#### PIPELINE CREATION AND EXECUTION

To deploy the pipeline, run the following commands in Cloud9’s terminal

```bash text
aws cloudformation  create-stack --stack-name E2EAssurance --template-url https://aws-wrkshp-artifacts.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/awsworkshop_infrastructure_artefacts/awsworkshop_e2e_assurance.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```



Go to the [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) console and check the status of your pipeline stack creation named 'E2EAssurance'. It should state - {{% color info %}}“CREATE_IN_PROGRESS”{{% /color %}}

**INFO** – This step takes approximately 1 minute and if successful, you can see the status of STACK - ‘E2EAssurance’ as {{% color success %}}“CREATE_COMPLETE”{{% /color %}} as shown in the screenshot below:
