In this module, we have witnessed the end-to-end successful test execution for a happy path scenario. The idea is to demonstrate how the continuous pipelines will be executed in real time progressing the code through various quality gates and ensuring that the every aspect of a code change is tested and confirmed before it is certified for pre-production environments. 

As discussed at the start, we have now seen how Testing in DevOps should be continuous in execution, collaborative by nature, cognitive with its decision-making and cloud ready in its architecture. In this module, we have seen a brief demonstration of how it all comes together in real time. 


Well done! You have successfully executed the end-to-end testing pipeline. 

Let us recap our leanings and discuss the next steps in the next section.
