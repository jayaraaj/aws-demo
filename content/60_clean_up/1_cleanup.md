When you are ready, just follow these last two steps to clean up the resources that were setup just for this workshop.

In order to prevent charges to your account we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running so you can examine the workshop a bit more please remember to do the cleanup when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an AWS account, forget about it, and then accrue charges.

Copy, paste and execute the following commands into Cloud9â€™s terminal in sequence to commence the cleanup activity.


```bash
wget https://aws-wrkshp-artifacts.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/awsworkshop_infrastructure_artefacts/awsworskhop_cleanup_environment.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x awsworskhop_cleanup_environment.sh
```

```bash
./awsworskhop_cleanup_environment.sh
```

**INFO**: This complete step takes approximately 5 minutes and if successful, you should see the following relevant messages for each command as below:

In the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), go to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) and verify that none of the stacks are listed in CloudFormation and you are done.

- In the AWS console, navigate to [Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home).
