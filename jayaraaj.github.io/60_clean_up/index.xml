      <description>When you are ready, just follow these last two steps to clean up the resources that were setup just for this workshop.
In order to prevent charges to your account, we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running, so you can examine the workshop a bit more, then please remember to do the clean-up when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an AWS account, forget about it, and then accrue charges.</description>
